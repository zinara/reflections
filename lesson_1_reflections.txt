How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? It helped show the bug to me faster by showing me the difference between the old and the updated file. through this I could locate the bug faster rather than doing it manually which would have been tedious and time consuming.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? If i can view where i came from it came help me to visualize where i am going. having the ability to view older versions of my work helps me to know if my work is still following the path which i first intended that it should take, it would also help me compare to see it there are places that need more attention and if there are notes i left for my future self in the older versions, i would like to know so as to stick to them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? well the advantage is that all the commits you will make manually are done by you and will seem logical when you read them again while the disadvantage of manual commits is that you might commit to big or too little clusterig your workspace or not having enough info to go on. but if they are automatically saved you would have the advantage of setting the the time-lapse of every commit and when they get to happen while it has the disadvantage of committing too early or too late.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? i think it has to do with the relationship between those files which git belives s important and google docs does not.
