Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?The only reason that i can think of why i would like to manually pull my remote repository is if i have no plan of adding the new file i created in GitHub into my local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Forks as i understand them are repository clones which takes place on GitHub between two github accounts, Clones on the other hand are as the name implies is the transfer of the content of a file in GitHub to your local computer. Branches on the other hand are seperate sections on a repository which its administrator made since he believes that the contents to be created in them are not yet fit to be added to the main branch. So in summary i would use a fork when i want to clone another user repository in github to my own while i would use clone when i want to clone a repository to my own computer and git Branch for experiment and for testing out new features.
